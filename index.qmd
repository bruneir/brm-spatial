## Introduction

Motivation...

### Types of GIS data

Roughly speaking, there are 4 types of GIS data.

1.  **Points**
    -   Having $(X, Y)$ coordinates (latitude, longitude, or projected coordinates, and are "zero-dimensional".
    -   E.g. shopping malls, hospitals, outbreaks, etc.
2.  **Lines**
    -   A collection of points that form a path or a boundary. Has length.
    -   E.g. roads, rivers, pipelines, etc.
3.  **Polygons**
    -   A closed area made up of line segments or curves.
    -   E.g. countries, districts, buildings, etc.
4.  **Raster**
    -   Pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated with a geographical area and some measurement.
    -   E.g. satellite images, elevation data, etc.

The first three are usually referred to as *vector data*. GIS data can be stored in various formats such as `.shp` or `.geojson`. The handling of GIS data (at least vector type data) is facilitated by the `{sf}` package [@pebesma2023spatial] which uses the *simple features* standard.

::: callout-note
*Simple features* refers to a formal standard (ISO 19125-1:2004) that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the spatial geometry of these objects.
:::

It's helpful to think about the shape of this spatial data set. As an example, here's a random slice of 10 kampong-level population data for Brunei:

```{r}
left_join(
  kpg_sf, 
  bn_census2021, 
  by = join_by(id, kampong, mukim, district)
) |>
  select(
    kampong, population, geometry
  ) |>
  slice_sample(n = 10)
  

```

Spatial data analysis must have these two components:

1.  The study variables (in the above example, this is population data).
2.  GIS data regarding that study variable.

If we only have 1 without 2, then it really is just a regular data analysis (stating the obvious). Adding the GIS data is a process called "geocoding" the data points.

::: callout-note
In R, geocoding using `{tidyverse}` can be achieved using the `dplyr::left_join()` or similar `xxx_join()` family of functions.
:::

## Point data

Using the data from @jaafar2023data . There are three datasets provided.

1.  GIS data ([WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System "World Geodetic System") coordinates) of all study plots.
2.  Soil physicochemical property data. This contains details of soil physical, chemical, nutrient concentration of the three habits studied.
3.  Soil texture classification. Provides details on the classification of the soil texture in the habitats studied.

We will first load the data sets in R.

```{r}
## Load the data sets
soil_gps <- read_csv(
  "data/8389823/GPS - Revised.csv", 
  # IMPORTANT!!! The csv file has latin1 encoding as opposed to UTF-8
  locale = readr::locale(encoding = "latin1")
)
  
soil_physico <- read_csv("data/8389823/Soil physicochemical properties.csv")
soil_texture <- read_csv("data/8389823/Soil texture classification.csv")
```

### Clean up the point data

Let's take a look at the point data set.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
glimpse(soil_gps)
```

The first three columns are essentially the identifiers of the plots (forest type, habitat type, and the unique identification code for the study plot). However, the latitude and longitude needs a bit of cleaning up, because it's currently in character format. This needs to be in a formal Degree Minute Second `DMS` class that R can understand. For this we will use the `sp::char2dms()` function.

As an example let's take a look at the first latitude.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
x <- soil_gps$Latitude[1]
x

# convert it using sp::char2dms() function
x <- sp::char2dms(x, chd = "Â°")
x
str(x)
```

This is a special class that R understands as being a latitude from Earth. To convert it to decimal, we just do `as.numeric()`:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
as.numeric(x)
```

Now let's do this for all the values in the `soil_gps` data. We will use the `dplyr::mutate()` function in a pipeline.

```{r}
soil_gps <-
  soil_gps |>
  mutate(
    Latitude = as.numeric(sp::char2dms(Latitude, chd = "Â°")),
    Longitude = as.numeric(sp::char2dms(Longitude, chd = "Â°"))
  )
soil_gps
```

### Preliminary plot of the data

Using the data contained in the `{bruneimap}` package, we can plot the study areas on a map of Brunei.
Use either the `brn_sf`, `dis_sf`, `mkm_sf` or `kpg_sf` data sets.

```{r}
ggplot(brn_sf) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data = soil_gps, aes(Longitude, Latitude)) 
```

We can zoom in a bit... but we have to find out manually the correct bounding box.

```{r}
ggplot(mkm_sf) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = dis_sf, fill = NA, col = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(data = soil_gps, aes(Longitude, Latitude)) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = soil_gps,
    aes(Longitude, Latitude, label = Plot_name),
    box.padding = 0.5,
    max.overlaps = 30
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(114.4, 114.6),
    ylim = c(4.5, 4.7)
  )
```


### Merge with the study data

Let's take a look at the data set.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
glimpse(soil_physico)
glimpse(soil_texture)
```

The `soil_physico` and `soil_texture` data sets contain the same columns, so we might as well merge them together. 
We will use the `dplyr::left_join()` function.

```{r}
# Actually I just want to merge these two together
soil_df <- left_join(
  soil_physico,
  soil_texture,
  by = join_by(Habitat_type, Plot_name, Subplot_name, Soil_depth)
)
soil_df
```

Once we've done that, the `soil_df` data set (the study variables) is actually missing the spatial data. 
We need to geocode it with the `soil_gps` data set.
Again, `dplyr::left_join()` to the rescue!

```{r}
soil_df <- left_join(
  soil_df, 
  soil_gps,
  by = join_by(Habitat_type, Plot_name)
)
```

Now we're in a position to plot the study variables on the map.
Note that there are only 18 plots in the `soil_gps` data set, and each plot has repeated measurements. 
That means when we plot it, it will overlap and look like a single point. 
So a good thing to do is to jitter the point so it's easier to see.

```{r}
ggplot(kpg_sf) +
  geom_sf(fill = NA) +
  geom_jitter(
    data = soil_df, 
    aes(Longitude, Latitude, col = Nitrogen, size = Nitrogen, 
        shape = Habitat_type),
    width = 0.001, height = 0.001, alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(114.46, 114.54),
    ylim = c(4.58, 4.64)
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  guides(size = "none")
```

### Predictive models

At this stage, we probably want to consult an expert in this field, and ask what variables are important for predicting the nitrogen content in the soil, so that we can build a *predictive model*.
In mathematics, a model is simply a relationship between variables, like so:
$$
y = f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_p) + \epsilon
$$
where the $x_1,\dots,x_p$ are the input variables, and $y$ is the output variable of interest (in this case, nitrogen concentrations).
No model can perfectly account for this relationship, so we add a term $\epsilon$ which represents the error in the model.
Ideally this should be as small as possible.

Several models, ranging from classical statistical models to complex machine learning models, are possible:

1. Linear regression model -- `lm()`
2. Generalised additive models (GAM) [@wood2017generalized] -- `mgcv::gam()`
3. Gaussian process regression (Kriging) -- `kernlab::gausspr()`
4. Random forests -- `randomForest::randomForest()`
5. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) -- `spgwr::gwr()`

Let's focus on Gaussian process regression (because that's one that I know quite well).
The idea of GPR is to model the relationship between the input variables and the output variable as a multivariate Gaussian distribution:
$$
f(x) \sim \operatorname{N}\big(0, K(x,x')\big)
$$
where $K(x,x')$ is the covariance function, which measures the similarity between the input variables $x$ and $x'$.
The most common covariance function is the squared exponential function:
$$
K(x,x') = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^p (x_i - x'_i)^2\right).
$$
Let $d$ represent the "distance" between two points. 
Then the squared exponential kernel becomes very small when this distance $d$ is large, and very large when $d$ is small.
Put another way, since elements of the matrix $K$ represent co-variability, that means two points that are close together will behave similarly, and vice versa.
This is very much in line with Tobler's first law of geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things".

```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 100)
y <- exp(-x^2)
tibble(d = x, Kxx = y) |>
  ggplot(aes(d, Kxx)) +
  geom_line() 
```

Given the assumed behaviour of our function $f(x)$, and what is observed from the data, we can then make predictions about the nitrogen content at unobserved locations.
Skipping over a whole lot of mathematics, let's just fit this model in R.

```{r}
library(kernlab)

# Build a model to predict Nitrogen from all numeric variables. This is
# definitely not theory based, so just want to show the code.
soil_df <-
  soil_df |>
  select(where(is.numeric)) 
mod <- gausspr(Nitrogen ~ ., data = soil_df)
mod
```

Having done that, we now want to prepare a prediction data frame.
Essentially, we will rasterise the study area into a predefined grid.
For the other variables, we will just set them at their mean values.

```{r}
xr <- c(114.4, 114.6)
xx <- seq(xr[1] - 0.01, xr[2] + 0.01, length = 100)

yr <- c(4.5, 4.7)
yy <- seq(yr[1] - 0.01, yr[2] + 0.01, length = 100)

mean_X <- 
  soil_df |>
  summarise(across(everything(), mean)) |>
  select(-Longitude, -Latitude)

pred_df <-
  expand_grid(
    Longitude = xx,
    Latitude = yy
  ) |>
  bind_cols(mean_X)

pred_df$ypred <- predict(mod, newdata = pred_df)

# Additional step: filter points that are outside of the Brunei land area.
pred_sf <- 
  pred_df |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326) |>
  st_filter(y = brn_sf[1, ])

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(
    data = pred_sf,
    aes(fill = ypred, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates",
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  # geom_raster(data = pred_df, aes(Longitude, Latitude, fill = ypred),
  #             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_sf(data = kpg_sf, fill = NA, inherit.aes = FALSE, col = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = dis_sf, fill = NA, col = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(data = soil_gps, aes(Longitude, Latitude, 
                                  shape = Habitat_type)) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = soil_gps,
    aes(Longitude, Latitude, label = Plot_name),
    box.padding = 0.5,
    max.overlaps = 30
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  scale_colour_viridis_c() +
  coord_sf(xlim = xr, ylim = yr)
```

## Line data (`(MULTI)LINESTRING`)

For this example, we'll play with the road network shape file obtained from OpenStreetMaps.
The data is in geojson format, so let's import that into R.

```{r}
brd <- 
  read_sf("data/hotosm_brn_roads_lines_geojson/hotosm_brn_roads_lines_geojson.geojson") |>
  sf::st_transform(4326)  # SET THE CRS!!! (WGS84)
glimpse(brd)
```

There are 25,570 features in this data set, which may be a bit too much.
Let's try to focus on the major roads only.
This information seems to be contained in the `highway` column.
What's in it?

```{r}
table(brd$highway)
```

According to this [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Carto/Lines), In OpenStreetMap, the major roads of a road network are sorted on an importance scale, from motorway to quaternary road.

![](osm_roads.png)

```{r}
brd_mjr <- 
  brd |>
  filter(highway %in% c("motorway", "trunk", "primary", "secondary")) 
brd_mjr
```

And now a plot of these roads.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = brn_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = brd_mjr, aes(col = highway), size = 0.5) +
  # scale_colour_viridis_d(option = "turbo")
  ggsci::scale_colour_npg()
```

With this, I asked ChatGPT what kind of spatial analyses can be done on this data set. 
It said, when paired with appropriate data, we can do things like:

1. **Network Connectivity Analysis**
   - Assess reachability and identify disconnected road network components.

2. **Accessibility and Service Area Analysis**
   - Determine service areas and catchment areas for essential services.

3. **Traffic Simulation and Management**
   - Simulate traffic flow to identify bottlenecks and suggest optimal routing.

4. **Environmental Impact Assessment**
   - Estimate vehicular emissions and model noise pollution from roads.

5. **Urban and Regional Planning**
   - Examine land use compatibility and assess infrastructure development needs.

6. **Safety Analysis**
   - Identify accident hotspots and assess pedestrian safety.

7. **Economic Analysis**
   - Evaluate economic accessibility and the impact of road projects.

Let's pick one of these: Calculate the distance between the centroid of several regions and the major hospital in the Belait district. 
This analysis guides urban and healthcare planning by pinpointing areas with inadequate access to emergency services, enabling targeted infrastructure and service improvements. 

### Road networks in Belait region

First we "crop" the road network to the Belait region.

```{r}
brd_belait <- 
  brd |>
  st_intersection(filter(dis_sf, name == "Belait"))

ggplot(brd_belait) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = filter(dis_sf, name == "Belait"), fill = NA)
```

If we were to sample random points from the Belait polygon, we might get non-sensical areas like the extremely rural areas or forest reserves.
So the idea is to sample random points from the road network itself.
For this, we need a function that will get us a random point on the path itself.

```{r}
get_random_point <- function(linestring) {
  coords <- st_coordinates(linestring)
  samp_coord <- coords[sample(nrow(coords), 1), , drop = FALSE]
  samp_coord[, 1:3]
}
get_random_point(brd_belait$geometry[1])
```

Once we have this function, we need to `map()` this function onto each of the linestrings in the `brd_belait` data set.
The resulting list of points is too large! 
So we will just sample 100 points (you can experiment with this number).
 
```{r}
random_points <-
  map(brd_belait$geometry, get_random_point) |>
  bind_rows() |>
  slice_sample(n = 100)
```

What we have now is a data frame of 100 random points on the road network in the Belait district.
We will use the `{osrm}` package to calculate the distance between these points and the Suri Seri Begawan Hospital in Kuala Belait.
The output will be three things: 1) The duration (minutes); 2) The distance (km); and 3) a `LINESTRING` object that represents the path to get to the hospital.
Unfortunately the `osrmRoute()` function is not vectorised, i.e. we have to do it one-by-one for each of the 100 points.
Luckily, we can just make a `for` loop and store the results in a list.

```{r}
library(osrm)
suriseri <- c(114.198778, 4.583444)

res <- list()
for (i in 1:100) {
  res[[i]] <- osrmRoute(src = random_points[i, 1:2], dst = suriseri, overview = "full")
}
res <- 
  bind_rows(res) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  st_as_sf()
res
```

So with all that done, we can now plot the paths taken by the 100 random points to the hospital. 
The map gives us an indication of which areas are underserved by the hospital, and can guide urban and healthcare planning by pinpointing areas with inadequate access to emergency services, enabling targeted infrastructure and service improvements.

```{r}
ggplot(res) +
  # geom_point(data = random_points, aes(x = X, y = Y), col = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = filter(kpg_sf, district == "Belait"), fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(aes(col = duration), linewidth = 1.2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(x = suriseri[1], y = suriseri[2], col = "red3", pch = "X", 
             size = 3) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c() 
```

Improving the analysis

- Weight analysis by populous areas. Outcalls to hospitals can be modelled using a Poisson distribution with the population as the rate parameter.
- Use a more sophisticated routing algorithm that accounts for traffic conditions and road quality (am vs pm, weekends vs weekdays, etc.).
- Simpler to analyse at the kampong or mukim level? 

## Areal data (`(MULTI)POLYGONS`)

::: {.callout-tip title="What we'll learn"}
-   Represent statistical data using colour mapping symbology (choropleth)
-   Use `ggplot2::geom_label()` or `ggrepel::geom_label_repel()` to add labels to the map
-   Using a binned colour scale, e.g. `ggplot2::geom_scale_fill_viridis_b()`
:::

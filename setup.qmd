<u>Addendum</u>

Depending on the OS you are using, you may need to install additional developer tools.

- For Windows users, you may need to install Rtools from [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

- For Mac users, you may need to install Xcode from the App Store (or see here [https://mac.r-project.org/tools/](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)).

- Linux users should be fine, as the necessary compiler tools are usually installed by default.
